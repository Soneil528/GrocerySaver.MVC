    <h1>Grocery Saver</h1>
    <p class="lead">Grocery Saver is a handy web application that lets you know what perishable groceries that you have are close to and have expired. This application
    also makes a list of the groceries that you need to consume soon before they expire hence "Grocery Saver". Groceries that have expired or if their currrent count
    has reached zero will be added to a list in order to remind you to pick these up at your local grocery supplier!</p>
